# E-commerce Chatbot

This **E-commerce Chatbot** is a virtual assistant built to enhance the customer experience on an e-commerce platform. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand customer queries, assist with product inquiries, provide order information, and facilitate a smoother shopping experience.

## About the Project

The **E-commerce Chatbot** is designed to automate customer support and guide users through product inquiries and order-related questions. By recognizing specific intents from user queries, the chatbot provides relevant responses and assists users in navigating the e-commerce platform.

## Features

- **Product Inquiry Assistance**: Helps users find products, check availability, and compare items.
- **Order Information**: Provides updates on order status, estimated delivery times, and return policies.
- **FAQ Responses**: Responds to frequently asked questions regarding the platform's policies.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Offers product suggestions based on customer preferences.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:

- **sys**: System-specific parameters and functions.
- **nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For tokenization, stemming, and other NLP functions.
- **numpy**: For handling numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
- **PorterStemmer**: For word stemming in NLP preprocessing.
- **punkt**: Tokenizer within nltk for breaking text into individual words.
- **torch, torch.nn**: Used to build and train the neural network model.
- **Dataset and DataLoader**: For organizing and loading data in batches.
- **flask**: To create a simple web-based frontend for the chatbot.
- **HTML and CSS**: For designing the user interface.

## Data and Training

The chatbot uses intents stored in a `intents.json` file. These intents include sample queries and corresponding categories, such as product-related questions, order tracking, and general FAQs.

The machine learning model is built using PyTorch and uses a neural network (`NeuralNet`) to classify user inputs into predefined intents. NLP techniques such as bag-of-words and stemming are applied to preprocess the text data.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, nltk
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS for the web interface
- **Data Storage**: JSON for intent data

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-chatbot.git
   cd ecommerce-chatbot
   ```

   Here's the specified section of the README file converted to Markdown (.md) code:

### Installation

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Make sure Python is installed, then install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy nltk torch flask
   ```
````

3. **Download nltk resources**:

   Run the following commands in Python to download necessary nltk data:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the app**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

1. **Run the server** using `python app.py`.
2. **Visit** `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
3. Enter customer queries like “What is the price of Product X?” or “Where is my order?”
4. The chatbot will respond based on trained intents, providing relevant information or redirecting to customer support if necessary.

## Frontend Interface

The chatbot is accessible through a simple web interface created with HTML and CSS. The frontend is powered by Flask and allows users to type queries directly and view responses in real-time.
